# For The Calculator
- Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… 
and don’t let it crash your calculator!
- Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)
- Make it look nice! This is a great project to practice your CSS skills. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.
- Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
- Add keyboard support!
- the ui.. good for mobile too/ atleast usable
